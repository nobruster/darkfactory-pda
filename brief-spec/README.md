<p align="center"><strong>Different agents in. One predictable human handoff out.</strong></p>

Brief-Spec is a type-aware, evidence-backed delivery contract for AI coding harnesses. Same fields, same order, preserved evidence. It does not make every answer shorter; it makes every important answer legible. Brief-Spec standardizes the explanation and handoff, not the agent's reasoning. It never calls a model.

## The problem

Good agent output can still be exhausting to consume.

Once several agents are running, generation is no longer the only bottleneck. Re-entry becomes the bottleneck. One response begins with a narrative. Another hides the decision below a test log. A third mixes completed work, caveats, and suggested work into the same paragraph.

Before acting, you must first discover how to read the answer.

![The same engineering session without Brief-Spec as a dense, irregular chat and with Brief-Spec as a calm, consistently structured handoff.](assets/briefspec-before-after.png)

Brief-Spec makes that last mile predictable. It keeps the agent's full work available while giving the human handoff a stable shape.

![Scattered session evidence flows into a Brief-Spec Outcome Brief and emerges as three directly answered human questions, while proof and unresolved boundaries remain visible.](assets/briefspec-output-comparison.png)

## How it works

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/flow.png" alt="How Brief-Spec works — host task through adapter, local type classification, and type-specific explanation; at a boundary a Checkpoint (Orient, Teach, or Spoken) or an Outcome Brief becomes a canonical delivery object and verified downloads, with inspectable proof from a repository, command, test, URL, or artifact." width="100%">

</details>

The host integrations normalize lifecycle events when the host provides them: session start, user prompt, completed tool use, pre-compaction, and agent stop.

Brief-Spec records bounded operational state, applies eligibility and cooldown rules, and injects guidance at the next available boundary. Hooks fail open: an internal Brief-Spec error is reported to standard error and the host receives an empty decision rather than a blocked session.

## Outcome Brief

A stable end-of-task contract. Seven fields, fixed order, five honest statuses.

### The contract

```text
Status → Outcome → Human action → Proof → Gaps → Next → Open
```

| Status | Meaning | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DONE` | Requested outcome achieved and directly verified | No required action, no unresolved gaps |
| `REVIEW` | Implementation ready for human inspection | Requires human action |
| `DECIDE` | A meaningful choice is required | Requires human action and an open decision |
| `BLOCKED` | External dependency prevents continuation | Requires a gap and a next action |
| `FAILED` | The attempt did not achieve the requested outcome | Requires a gap and a next action |

### Example

```markdown
<!-- briefspec:outcome:v1 -->
## Outcome Brief

Status: REVIEW
Outcome: The Copilot plugin, project bridge, and hook adapter are implemented.
Human action: Review the generated repository files before enabling the cloud hook.

Proof:
- [direct/info] `.github/plugin/marketplace.json` — declares the Copilot plugin source
- [direct/pass] `brief-spec doctor copilot --scope project --probe` → synthetic hook passed

Gaps:
- An authenticated Copilot cloud run has not been observed in this environment.

Next:
- Run the cloud acceptance scenario and retain its run URL.

Open:
- Whether cloud checkpoints should persist beyond the job.
<!-- /briefspec -->
```

Proof items are prefixed `[direct|derived|reported]/[pass|fail|info]`. See [`schemas/`](schemas/) for the machine-readable contracts.

## Why the skills exist

The CLI validates. The skills are how a chat agent finds the contract.

<th>When / not</th>
<th>Gate</th>
<th>Optional?</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>brief-spec</code></td>
<td>Classify substantive work and shape the full explanation for the selected profile</td>
<td>
<strong>When</strong> a task begins or clearly pivots; when the user asks Brief-Spec to explain work; or when a lifecycle hook supplies a type decision.<br>
<strong>Not</strong> sending task text to another model or network; inventing Grok classification metadata.

<strong>Not</strong> treating spoken mode as audio generation; claiming the checkpoint is canonical project memory; silently ingesting into Nexo or Obsidian.

### Eight work types

Each type has an ordered explanation profile loaded by the `brief-spec` router.

| Type | Explanation order |
| --- | --- |
| `general` | Answer, rationale, next action |
| `exploration` | Question, system map, entry points, flow, unknowns, next probe |
| `review` | Scope, verdict, findings, risk, validation, recommendation |
| `implementation` | Intent, changes, resulting behavior, verification, tradeoffs |
| `debugging` | Symptom, root cause, fix, regression protection, residual risk |
| `planning` | Goal, decisions, approach, sequence, gates |
| `research` | Question, synthesis, evidence quality, limitations, recommendation |
| `operations` | Event, impact, current state, actions, recovery, follow-up |

### Four reading experiences

| Experience | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Outcome** | Terminal handoff: what is true, what requires the human, what proves the claim |
| **Orient** | 30–45 second operational scan: where we are, what changed, next move |
| **Teach** | Plain-language mental model: what we did, why it works, example, watch-outs |
| **Spoken** | 80–240 word sequential script designed to be heard |

---

## Harness support

`brief-spec setup` installs skills and lifecycle hooks for each harness. Project destinations vary by host.

| Harness | Status | Command | Project destination |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | Required | `brief-spec setup codex` | `.codex/`, `.agents/skills/` |
| Claude Code | Required | `brief-spec setup claude` | `.claude/skills/` |
| OMP | Required | `brief-spec setup omp` | `.agents/skills/` |
| Grok Build | Required | `brief-spec setup grok` | `.grok/skills/` |
| Kimi Code | Required | `brief-spec setup kimi` | `.agents/skills/` |
| Copilot | Experimental | `brief-spec setup copilot --scope project` | `.agents/skills/`, `.github/` |
| Cursor Agent | Experimental | — | Unpublished |
| Goose | Experimental | — | `.agents/skills/` |

The five required harnesses retain their full v0.5.0 live baseline. Cursor Agent and Goose are experimental; Cursor paths are implemented but unpublished.

Project-scoped Copilot installation also creates the network-free bridge used by Copilot cloud coding agents:

```text
.agents/skills/{brief-spec,outcome-brief,session-checkpoint}/
.github/brief-spec/brief-spec.pyz
.github/hooks/brief-spec.json
.github/instructions/brief-spec.instructions.md
```

The installer merges lifecycle hooks instead of replacing the host file, refuses to overwrite foreign skill files, restores prior files if installation fails, and records what it owns.

A `.claude-plugin/` directory is present in this repository for local plugin development.

## CLI

### First journey

```bash
# Install the public release
uv tool install git+https://github.com/luanmorenommaciel/brief-spec.git@v0.2.0

# Verify the installation
brief-spec --version

# See the eight work types
brief-spec types

# Classify bounded task text (no network)
echo "Review the authentication module" | brief-spec classify - --json

# Validate an Outcome Brief
brief-spec validate outcome path/to/handoff.md

# Validate a Checkpoint
brief-spec validate checkpoint path/to/checkpoint.md --mode spoken

# Install harness integrations
brief-spec setup codex
brief-spec setup all --scope user --require codex,claude,omp,grok,kimi

# Check installation health
brief-spec doctor all --scope user --probe --all-scopes
```

### Export and verify

```bash
# Export to multiple formats
brief-spec export handoff.md \
  --formats markdown,json,html \
  --output-dir delivery/

# Bundle with manifest
brief-spec bundle handoff.md --output handoff.zip

# Verify the bundle
brief-spec verify handoff.zip --level rendered --offline --no-plugins

# Deliver with receipt
brief-spec deliver handoff.zip --to /path/to/deliveries/
brief-spec verify /path/to/deliveries/handoff.zip.receipt.json --level delivered
```

Verification levels are cumulative: `structural` → `resolved` → `rendered` → `delivered`. See [docs/delivery.md](docs/delivery.md) for the complete export and verification reference.

### Configuration

Create user or project configuration:

```bash
brief-spec config init
brief-spec config show
brief-spec config init --scope project --project /path/to/repository
```

Project values override user values. See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for policy options.

---

## Install

Brief-Spec requires **Python 3.11+**. The canonical distribution is not yet on PyPI.

### Public release (v0.2.0)

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/luanmorenommaciel/brief-spec.git@v0.2.0
```

### Dogfood from checkout (0.5.0)

```bash
uv tool install --force --reinstall \
  --with ./packages/brief-spec-renderer-pdf \
  --with ./packages/brief-spec-renderer-audio \
  .
brief-spec setup all --scope user --require codex,claude,omp,grok,kimi
brief-spec doctor all --scope user --probe --all-scopes
```

Project-scoped installation keeps the integration inside one repository:

```bash
brief-spec setup all --scope project --project /path/to/repository
brief-spec doctor all --scope project --project /path/to/repository --probe
```

The tagged URL installs a versioned release instead of whatever happens to be on `main`.

---

## Who this is for

Brief-Spec is for engineers and teams running multiple AI coding agents who want a predictable handoff without rebuilding their workflow.

### Who this is not for

- If you want a second brain or knowledge graph, Brief-Spec is not that. Use Nexo, Obsidian, or your preferred knowledge system.
- If you want an agent orchestrator, Brief-Spec is not that. It is the human handoff, not the task executor.
- If you want to replace Git, CI, or your issue tracker, Brief-Spec is not that. Original evidence remains authoritative.

Brief-Spec is a presentation layer. The original repository, command output, document, or host transcript remains the source of truth.

---

## Safety invariants

Brief-Spec compresses presentation, not provenance.

- A brief is never more authoritative than its source.
- A passing syntax check does not prove a live integration.
- A local commit does not prove publication.
- Planned work is not completed work.
- Direct, derived, and reported evidence must remain distinguishable.
- Unknown or unverified state is a gap, not a reason to infer success.
- Hooks fail open on internal errors.
- Installation refuses destructive overwrite of foreign files.
- Nothing is silently ingested into Nexo, Obsidian, or another knowledge system.

The JSON schemas in [`schemas/`](schemas/) define the portable data contracts.

## Honest limits

- A consistent format cannot make an unsupported claim true.
- A checkpoint cannot recover evidence the host never exposed.
- Lifecycle automation depends on the events supported by each host version.
- Spoken Brief is text until a separate text-to-speech system renders it.
- Automatic checkpoint thresholds are heuristics and remain configurable.
- Brief-Spec reduces reading friction; high-risk changes still deserve direct inspection.

---

## Experimental: Human Continuity

The source tree contains an optional, independently versioned Chronicle extension. It does not change the frozen Outcome Brief or Session Checkpoint `1.0` contracts and is not part of the public v0.2.0 or source candidate 0.5.0 publication claims.

Chronicle is never activated globally. It records what Brief-Spec observed; it does not replace Seamwise intent, Task-Spec acceptance, Converge authorization, Git evidence, or reviewed durable knowledge.

Read the complete [Human Continuity architecture](docs/human-continuity.md).

---

## Release truth

| Version | State | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| v0.2.0 | Published GitHub release | Latest public release |
| 0.5.0 | Source candidate | Locally verified; awaits live/hosted/publication gates |
| 0.3.0, 0.4.0 | Unpublished | Folded into 0.5.0 |

"Locally verified" does not mean hosted or published. See the full [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) and [verification record](docs/verification.md).

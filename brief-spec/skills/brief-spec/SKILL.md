description: Classify substantive coding-agent work and shape the full explanation for reviews, explorations, implementations, debugging, planning, research, operations, or general questions. Use when a task begins or clearly pivots; when the user asks Brief-Spec to explain work; or when a Brief-Spec lifecycle hook supplies a type decision.

# Brief-Spec Router

<!-- brief-spec:skill:v1 -->

Choose one primary work type and one subject. Adapt the full explanation to the selected profile;
retain the Outcome Brief or Session Checkpoint as the shared terminal contract.

## Route the task

1. Honor an explicit type from the user or host.
2. On Grok Build, do not run the classifier from the model or search for its executable. Grok's
   native passive hooks record the deterministic decision but cannot inject stdout into the model
   turn. Select the matching profile provisionally and put the profile sections plus the Outcome
   Brief or Session Checkpoint in the same first user-visible response. Do not emit the brief
   first and wait for Stop to add the profile sections; Grok already painted that first message,
   so a continuation would show those sections after the brief. Copy exact classification
   metadata only when Stop continues a turn that still lacks a valid brief. Do not invent
   `classified_at` or `decision_id` values.
3. On other harnesses, when available, run `brief-spec classify - --json` with only the bounded
   current task text. Do not send task text to another model or network service.
4. Use `general` when signals conflict or remain ambiguous.
5. Normalize the subject to a short slug, such as `pull-request`, `codebase`, `bug`, or `release`.
6. Keep the selection stable for the task. Change it only for an explicit override, a new task, or a
   clear user pivot; tool choice alone is not a pivot.
7. Read exactly one matching profile:
   - [general](references/general.md)
   - [exploration](references/exploration.md)
   - [review](references/review.md)
   - [implementation](references/implementation.md)
   - [debugging](references/debugging.md)
   - [planning](references/planning.md)
   - [research](references/research.md)
   - [operations](references/operations.md)

## Add method context without creating another work type

- Keep method context independent from work type and subject.
- When the hook supplies `seamwise`, `task-spec`, or `converge`, explain the current method phase
  in plain language: what is happening, why it matters, and the next human-relevant action.
- Use a step map or Mermaid diagram only when it clarifies real supplied relationships.
- If several method names appear without a clear active method, use `general`; do not guess.
- The Human Frame adapts the substantive response but is not another stored brief. Outcome Brief
  and Session Checkpoint remain the only lifecycle contracts.

## Preserve the shared contract

- Use the profile for the main explanation; do not force all work into one generic narrative.
- Keep direct, derived, and reported evidence distinct.
- Do not imply that classification proves the answer.
- End substantive terminal work with `outcome-brief`.
- Use `session-checkpoint` only at an explicit or eligible lifecycle boundary.
- Subagents contribute evidence and work state; the main task owns the user-facing brief.

At a terminal Outcome or Checkpoint, use one outer typed region around the profile explanation and
the unchanged legacy brief. Copy the classification metadata supplied by the hook or classifier:

```markdown
<!-- brief-spec:typed:v1 type={work_type} subject={subject} confidence={confidence} origin={origin} classified_at={classified_at} profile=1.0 -->
### {first profile section}

Type-specific content.

<!-- briefspec:outcome:v1 -->
...the unchanged Outcome Brief contract...
<!-- /briefspec -->
<!-- /brief-spec -->
```

The braced values above are placeholders. Replace every one with the classifier result; never copy
the placeholder text or invent a fixed example timestamp.

Do not create new timestamps while rendering downloads; canonical creation and classification times
must be captured once.

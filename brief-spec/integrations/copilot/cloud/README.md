# Copilot cloud bridge

`briefspec install copilot --scope project --project <path>` installs a network-free bridge into
the target repository:

- `.github/hooks/briefspec.json`
- `.github/briefspec/briefspec.pyz`
- `.github/instructions/briefspec.instructions.md`
- shared skills under `.agents/skills/`

The zipapp is built from the same Python core used locally. Copilot cloud jobs do not inherit
personal plugins and run in an ephemeral, network-restricted Linux sandbox, so the bridge keeps the
hook executable inside the repository. The bridge stores only ephemeral session counters during a
job and does not send data to an external service.

The repository hook uses the PascalCase event form understood by VS Code and accepted by Copilot
CLI/cloud. Brief-Spec emits the native Copilot response fields together with the VS Code-compatible
hook envelope where the response shapes differ. This keeps one checked-in bridge usable across
local editor sessions and ephemeral cloud jobs.

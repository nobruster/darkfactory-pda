# test-repo-layout.sh — the tree shape is a contract, not a convention.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# On 2026-08-17 the repository was reorganized: 27 top-level entries became 19,
# four directories were folded (presentation/ -> docs/decks/, review/ ->
# docs/reviews/, brand-kit-v1/ -> assets/, brand/ -> assets/), and ~32 MB of
# retired binaries left the tree. README.md documents the result in a table.
#
# A table is documentation. Documentation does not fail a build. Nothing stopped
# the next change from reintroducing a top-level scratch directory, or from
# quietly contradicting the table it was supposed to match. Every other structural
# claim in this repo is gated — the docs inventory, the package allowlist, the
# CLI matrix, tracked debris — except the shape of the tree itself.
#
# This closes that hole. Add a top-level entry without deciding it belongs, and
# this fails with the exact name to justify or remove.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS
#   1. the tracked top-level set is exactly ALLOWED_* below
#   2. every directory that is a documented home carries a README
#   3. no retired path resurfaces (presentation/, brand/, docs/handbook/, ...)
#   4. README.md's directory table names every tracked top-level directory
#
# Token: LAYOUT=PASS | LAYOUT=FAIL
# bash 3.2 safe. Deps: git, grep, sed.

# that has nothing to do with the loop — and it survived a bisect across three
# commits, one of which CI had passed, because CI installs shellcheck explicitly.
#
# A suite that cannot run should say SO, once, at the top. The repo already makes
# this argument about secret-gated CI jobs: a silently-skipped gate is worse than
# no gate. A silently-swallowed prerequisite is the same defect wearing a green
# hat — every row fails, so nothing looks like a precondition.

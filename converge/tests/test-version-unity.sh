#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test-version-unity.sh — Converge ships as ONE unit, at ONE version.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# Before 2026-07-29 the package carried NINE accidental version lineages: the
# skills once declared seven different `metadata.version` values (0.3.0 .. 1.1.0)
# or none at all, `bin/cvg` said 0.21.0, and two gate
# scripts kept private numbers behind their own `--version` flags. Nothing
# reconciled them, so "which version of Converge is this?" had no answer — and a
# skill could be edited without anything downstream noticing.
#
# The fix is not to force independent products onto one number. VERSION owns the
# Converge package; Task-Spec is now an external engine with an explicit compatible
# range. A Converge declaration must equal VERSION, and the engine boundary must
# resolve to 3.8.x (release pin 3.8.0). 3.9.x writes absolute _state.yaml paths.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS A VERSION HERE
# RELEASE versions unify — they answer "which Converge is this?". SCHEMA/FORMAT
# versions deliberately do NOT: `format_version: 3`, `VALIDATOR_VERSION="2"`,
# `agent_contract.version: 2` and `hmac-sha256-v3` describe a DATA CONTRACT whose
# whole purpose is to change independently of the release. Conflating the two
# would force a data migration on every release, which is the opposite of what a
# schema version is for. This gate checks release versions only, and the SCHEMA
# allowlist below is the recorded distinction.
#
# Usage:
#   bash tests/test-version-unity.sh            # gate (exit 0 pass / 1 fail)
#   bash tests/test-version-unity.sh --sync     # rewrite every site to VERSION
#
# Last line is always exactly one machine token:
#   VERSION_UNITY=PASS | VERSION_UNITY=FAIL | VERSION_UNITY=SYNCED
#
# bash 3.2 safe (stock macOS). Deps: grep, sed, awk.

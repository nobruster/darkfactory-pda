# check-brd.sh — Converge Pass 0 gate checker (the exit contract).
#
# Three modes:
#   canonical (default)  The handoff gate. Structure AND authorization: the
#                        owner's sign-off must say 'canonical' on the verdict
#                        line itself (a verdict carrying 'pending'/'draft'
#                        never authorizes) with a VALID calendar-real ISO
#                        date on a Date/Signed line, scope In/Out must carry
#                        real entries (a bullet saying "none"/"n/a" is not an
#                        entry), every open question a nonblank owner in the
#                        record shape, every numbered Problem line
#                        provenance-tagged on its line, (guessed) numbers
#                        linked to an open question.
#                        ONLY this mode may print the Pass 1 handoff verdict.
#   --draft              Validation while writing. Same structural checks;
#                        ownership/provenance/sign-off items downgrade to
#                        warnings. NEVER authorizes handoff, no matter how
#                        complete the brief.
#   --no-go <file>       Validates a no-go record (the pass's other honest
#                        exit): a no-go marker, a calendar-real ISO date,
#                        the do-nothing reasoning (why), what would reopen
#                        it, and a named owner for the call.
#
# All checks run on the file with fenced code blocks stripped — an example
# inside ``` fences can neither satisfy nor trip a check (v0.3.1).
#
# Section headings match EXACTLY (v0.4.0): '## Problematic' does not satisfy
# '## Problem' — the heading must be the template's name followed by
# whitespace (e.g. '## Goals & KPIs') or end of line, case-insensitive.
#
# ISO dates are calendar-real (v0.4.0): the regex screens shape and month/day
# ranges, python3 datetime proves the date exists (2026-02-31 is not a date).
# Without python3 the gate falls back to the regex and WARNs — never silent.
#
# Semantic judgment (owner voice, altitude leaks) stays WARN in every mode —
# the human judges voice; this script mechanizes only the provable. Hygiene
# items (do-nothing evidence, a >60-word executive summary, an unnamed
# decider) are likewise WARN-only in every mode (v0.4.0).
#
# Agent contract: the LAST line is always a stable machine token —
#   CHECK_BRD=PASS | FAIL | DRAFT_OK | DRAFT_INCOMPLETE | NOGO_OK
#             | NOGO_INVALID | USAGE_ERROR
# so a harness greps one line and never parses prose. Usage errors exit 2
# AND still end in CHECK_BRD=USAGE_ERROR (v0.3.1 — agents are users too).
#
# PDF policy: this verifier reads text (.md). A .pdf brief is a consensus
# object — convert it (or emit --out-format md) and gate the .md.
#
# bash 3.2 safe (macOS system bash).

# adapters/linear-projection.sh — T2 projection-block resolvers for the Linear
# backend. FUNCTION-ONLY: this file defines helpers and nothing else. It is
# SOURCED by adapters/linear.sh (behind an existence guard) AFTER the core
# helpers are defined and BEFORE _ln_main, so it may freely rely on:
#   _linear_gql, tsi_ln_die, _ln_find_by_external_id, LINEAR_TEAM_ID
# (the parent's _ln_find_by_external_id encapsulates the marker-URL construction,
# so this file never touches _ln_marker_url directly.)
# It intentionally does NOT `set -euo pipefail` (linear.sh already did, and a
# sourced companion must not carry global side effects), defines no verbs, and is
# never added to dispatch. curl/jq are guaranteed present: every verb that calls
# these has already run _ln_require_tools.
#
# The three resolvers here back the `projection:` frontmatter block (see
# references/projection-block.md): cycle placement, parent nesting, and the
# one-level-deep depth guard Linear enforces on sub-issues. Each is READ-ONLY and
# FAIL-SOFT — an unresolved optional field echoes empty so the caller can retry
# the mutation without it, exactly like _ln_set_due / _ln_label_ids upstream. The
# ONE deliberate hard stop (a parent that is itself a sub-issue) is surfaced by
# _ln_parent_depth_ok returning nonzero; the caller — never this file — decides to
# tsi_ln_die on it, so there is never a half-written issue.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# _ln_cycle_id NAME_OR_UUID — resolve a cycle to its UUID, SCOPED TO THE TEAM.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Echoes the cycle UUID, or empty if it does not resolve to a cycle on this team
# (which is exactly the "must belong to team" guarantee: the match is drawn only
# from LINEAR_TEAM_ID's own cycles, so a UUID from another team echoes empty).
# Accepts three human forms, all matched case-insensitively against the team's
# cycles:  a UUID (verified for membership), an explicit `name`, or a number —
# bare (`7`) or spelled (`Cycle 7`) — since most Linear cycles are unnamed and
# addressed by their sequence number. Fail-soft: any transport/parse failure
# echoes empty and returns 0, so an unresolved cycle is simply omitted.

# _ln_parent_ref SPEC_ID — resolve a parent SPEC id to its Linear issue UUID.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The parent is named in the child's `projection.parent` by its SPEC id, so it is
# resolved through the SAME idempotency marker that identifies every projected
# issue (_ln_find_by_external_id). Echoes the UUID, or empty when the parent has
# not been registered yet (a not-yet-created parent is a fail-soft skip, not an
# error — a transport error still propagates, consistent with the rest of the
# adapter). Register upserts in build order, so a declared parent is normally
# already on the board by the time its child is projected.

# _ln_parent_depth_ok PARENT_UUID — Linear's ONE-LEVEL-DEEP sub-issue guard.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Linear sub-issues nest exactly one level: an issue may have a parent OR
# children, never both. So a PARENT is only a legal nesting target when it has NO
# parent of its own. Returns 0 (safe to nest under) when PARENT has no parent;
# nonzero when PARENT is itself a sub-issue (depth would become >1). The CALLER
# decides what to do with a nonzero — the contract is to tsi_ln_die before any
# write — so this function never mutates and never aborts on its own.
# Fail-soft on an UNVERIFIABLE state (empty uuid, missing issue, transport error):
# returns 0, because "could not read the parent" is not a proven depth violation
# and must not spuriously abort a registration.

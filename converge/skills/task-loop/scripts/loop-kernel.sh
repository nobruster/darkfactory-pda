#!/usr/bin/env bash
# loop-kernel.sh — Pass 8's actual loop.
#
# Until this existed, Converge's "loop" ran the eval once and reported RED or
# GREEN. Every spec declared budget_iterations / max_iterations /
# circuit_breaker_no_progress / on_terminal_failure and NOTHING enforced them —
# the same defect class as WP4's unenforced external_writes policy.
#
# This is the loop specification made executable: a trigger, a goal, a
# verification, a stopping rule and a memory. See references/loop-spec.md for
# the design and its sources.
#
# THE SHAPE
#   attempt -> verify -> (green ? tier-2 -> settle : learn) -> repeat, bounded
#
#   * Each attempt spawns a FRESH agent process. State lives on disk, never in a
#     conversation, because every retry otherwise re-reads all prior failures
#     and the cost curve is quadratic while attention degrades.
#   * Verification is the task's own Exit Check — a level-1 deterministic check
#     the agent cannot edit, because the eval is HMAC-sealed and sits outside
#     the contract's fs.write scope.
#   * A GREEN eval is necessary, not sufficient. With --verify, a DIFFERENT
#     engine reads the diff, the spec's intent and the holdout — never the
#     worker's transcript — and is prompted to refute. Tier 1 catches mechanical
#     wrongness; only tier 2 catches a lookup table that satisfies the assertion.
#
#     It is OPT-IN, because it costs a full extra engine dispatch per green run
#     and a slow judge can spend more than the work did. Making it the default
#     was a mistake paid for immediately: a judge timed out at 300s and, because
#     tier 2 fails closed, BLOCKED a task whose three evals had all passed. The
#     rigor is real and belongs on high blast radius; charging every run for it
#     is how a control gets switched off wholesale instead of aimed.
#   * Stopping is a named terminal state. An error or an exhausted budget is
#     NEVER success.
#   * Budgets are three-axis (iterations, wall-clock, tokens) and checked BEFORE
#     each engine call, because a post-flight check has already spent the money.
#
# TERMINAL STATES (only the first three exit 0)
#   SETTLED | LOCAL_SETTLED | NO_OP | BLOCKED | STALLED | EXHAUSTED | CANCELLED | ERROR
#
# Usage:

#        [--verify] [--judge codex|kimi|claude|gemini]
#
# The last three are not the loop's own controls — they belong to the eval runner
# and the settler, and are forwarded verbatim so the kernel can sit in front of
# them without narrowing the surface that already existed.

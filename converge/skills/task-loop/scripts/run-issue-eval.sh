#!/usr/bin/env bash
# run-issue-eval.sh — resolve --issue N to its task-spec and run THAT task's own eval.
#
# This is the GATE of Pass 8 (The Loop). It takes ONE issue, finds the matching
# tasks/T-*.md, extracts the Success Criteria eval bodies + the Exit Check, runs
# each in an isolated `set -euo pipefail` subshell, and prints:
#   GREEN  — the Exit Check exited 0 (all evals passed)
#   RED    — the Exit Check exited non-zero (with the failing eval's output)
#
# It never picks the task — --issue N is required and comes from outside.
#
# Usage:
#   bash run-issue-eval.sh --issue <id|slug|path> [--tasks-dir DIR] [--quiet]
#                          [--contract PROFILE] [--legacy-no-contract]
#
# Resolution of --issue accepts, in order:
#   1. an exact path to a T-*.md file
#   2. a full task id            (T-20260625-bronze-views)
#   3. a bare slug / tail        (bronze-views  →  T-*-bronze-views.md)
#   4. a tracker ref             (matches linear_ref: / tracker_issue: N)
#
# Delegation: evaluation is owned by the independently installed Task-Spec
# engine. Converge resolves the task and workspace, then calls its public
# `taskspec run` surface. There is deliberately no embedded evaluator fallback:
# two implementations would create two meanings of the same sealed task.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — GREEN  (Exit Check exited 0)
#   1 — RED    (Exit Check exited non-zero)
#   2 — could not resolve / read the issue (a usage or upstream-gap error)
#
# bash-3.2-safe (macOS system bash): no mapfile, no `declare -A`, awk/grep/sed only.

# The WORKSPACE is the parent of the tasks dir, and it is the only directory an
# eval's relative paths can sensibly be resolved against — a spec that creates
# `cvg/capture/orders.py` means relative to its own workspace, not to whatever
# repo happens to contain it.
# THE WORKSPACE IS THE ANCESTOR THAT CONTAINS `cvg/`.
#
# This used to be "the parent of the tasks dir, and strip one more level if it is
# named cvg". That is only correct while specs live at exactly <ws>/cvg/tasks. A
# spec that FINISHES moves to <ws>/cvg/tasks/done, and then the parent is
# `cvg/tasks`, whose basename is not `cvg`, so nothing was stripped and the
# workspace resolved to `<ws>/cvg/tasks`. Every eval's relative path
# (`cvg/capture/pipelines/x.py`) then missed and the Exit Check failed in 0s —
# so a completed task could no longer pass its own evals, and `cvg tasks accept`
# rejected work that was demonstrably done.
#
# Walking up to the `cvg` component instead is correct for tasks/, tasks/done/,
# tasks/archive/ and any future nesting, because it asks the structural question
# ("where does the workspace begin?") rather than counting levels.
#
# This is the sixth symptom of one root cause: every gate deriving its own answer
# to "where is the workspace / what did this run change". The durable fix is a
# single shared resolver; this makes the most-used derivation correct first.

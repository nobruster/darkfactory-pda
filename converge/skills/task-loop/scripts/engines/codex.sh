# Positional prompt rather than stdin: `codex exec [PROMPT]` accepts it directly,
# and passing it as an argument removes a whole class of plumbing failure (a
# backgrounded job losing its redirect) that is invisible in the transcript —
# it looks like the model produced nothing.
# stdin MUST be explicitly closed. `codex exec` documents that "if stdin is
# piped and a prompt is also provided, stdin is appended as a <stdin> block" —
# so with an open-but-never-closed stdin it reads the positional prompt, does
# the work, and then BLOCKS forever waiting for an EOF that never arrives. The
# watchdog eventually kills it at 124 and the whole attempt reads as a timeout,
# which hides the fact that the model finished minutes earlier.
# Neutral tier -> this vendor's model ids. Codex names its own families, so the
# map is a real translation here rather than a pass-through.

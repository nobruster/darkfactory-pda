"""Tier-2 verification — grade the work with an engine that did not do the work.

WHY THIS EXISTS
The task's own evals are authored by the same intelligence that implements
against them, then that intelligence grades itself. Code graders catch mechanical
wrongness; they do not catch a lookup table that satisfies the assertion, or an
implementation that skirts the spec's intent while passing its letter. The field
measures LLM-generated code carrying vulnerabilities at 9.8-42.1%, with surviving
AI-introduced defects in production past 110,000 — self-grading is not enough.

The defense borrows train/test separation from ML:
  * tier 1 — the sealed eval the worker CAN see (`Exit Check`).
  * tier 2 — a HOLDOUT set the worker cannot see, plus a different-FAMILY judge
    that reads only the diff, the spec's intent, and the holdout — never the
    worker's transcript — and is prompted to REFUTE.
  * tier 3 — a human, scaled by blast radius.

FAILS CLOSED. A missing, malformed, or timed-out verdict is never a pass. When no
independent engine exists the verdict is UNAVAILABLE, which is allowed for small
blast radius and blocks for large — with `--accept-unverified` as the single
audited exit.

Usage:
  verify-work.py --task <spec> [--judge codex|kimi|claude] [--base REF]
                 [--accept-unverified] [--repo DIR] [--json]

    uncommitted. Worse, a `creates_paths` task's entire deliverable is UNTRACKED,
    and `git diff` does not mention untracked files at all. So on the first real
    green run the judge was handed an empty diff, reported ERROR, and the kernel
    (correctly, since it fails closed) blocked a task whose evals had all passed.
    The verifier was written for the post-hoc `cvg verify` case where the commit
    already existed; wiring it in front of settlement exposed the assumption.

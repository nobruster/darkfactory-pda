# tech-req-to-adrs — Converge Pass 2 (Structure)

Ground the Pass 1 tech-spec against the real system and record the grounding
decisions as ADRs. This pass lowers altitude from *what to build* (the spec) to
*what is true about the terrain we build on* (the ADRs). The deliverable is
files under `docs/adrs/`, not a session summary — v1 produced no file and the
understanding died with the session; this version writes it down so Pass 3 can
stand on it.

- **Converge pass:** 2 of 8 — STRUCTURE.
- **In:** the Pass 1 tech-spec (`docs/tech-spec-*.pdf|md`) + the real repo.
- **Out:** `docs/adrs/NNNN-<slug>.md`, one grounding decision per file, plus `docs/CONTEXT.md` — the domain glossary, updated as terms crystallize.
- **Gate:** the terrain is *named* and every grounding fact is recorded as an ADR a stranger can reconstruct — with no "build X" in any of them.

## Important

- **Terrain, not design.** An ADR records a **fact or constraint that already holds** and its evidence. The instant it says "build the output table that…" it has drifted into Pass 3 and must be split: the fact stays here, the design moves on. This no-drift invariant is the single failure mode of this pass and the only thing the gate truly enforces.
- **Run the brownfield; do not assume it.** Grounding requires reading and *running* the real source, not summarizing a doc. Reconcile the real state of your data store (row counts, contents, freshness) against what the spec assumed before you write a word.
- **Evidence over assertion.** Every ADR cites the line, count, or command output that makes it true (for example, a schema constraint such as `payments.order_id ... REFERENCES orders(order_id)` in a relational project, or the equivalent grounding fact for your stack), so the next engine trusts the file, not the author.
- **No engine/tracker flags.** The engine is fixed (Claude Code on the repo). There is no adversary and no tracker here; those bind in Pass 4 (`--adversary`) and the Fork B register (`--tracker`).
- **Lifecycle: proposed → accepted → deprecated | superseded (v0.4.0).**
  Records are born `proposed` and become `accepted` at review — never at
  scaffold time. **Accepted ADRs are immutable**: when a recorded fact stops
  being true (a fenced absence gets built, a schema migrates), do not edit
  history — scaffold the replacement with `--supersede NNNN`; the script
  stamps both directions (`supersedes:` / `superseded_by:`) and `--check`
  verifies the links. The pass cannot close while any record is still
  `proposed` (`--check --final`).
- **Records speak machine (agents are first-class consumers).** Metadata
  lives in YAML frontmatter (`status`, `date`, `ground`, `spec_ref`,
  `supersedes`, `superseded_by`, `deciders`) so Pass 3 / Pass 5 agents grep
  fields, never prose. `spec_ref` cites the requirement ID(s) (`R-n`) the
  fact grounds — the chain the whole descent stands on: R-n in the spec →
  ADR grounds it → plan cites the ADR → task eval verifies R-n. `--check`
  ends in a stable token: `CHECK_ADR=OK|FAIL|EMPTY|USAGE_ERROR`.

## Instructions

Three steps, in order: **Name the ground → Ground → Record**. The order is
load-bearing — you cannot record a constraint you have not verified, and
recording first would enshrine assumptions.

### Step 1 — Name the ground

State plainly whether this is **greenfield** (nothing exists; the ADRs record the
constraints the spec imposes) or **brownfield** (a working base exists; the ADRs
record what is already true). Write it in the first record — scaffold it with
`scaffold-adr.sh --context` → `docs/adrs/0000-context.md` (Terrain / Given
surface / Build surface / Spec pointer) — so every later decision is anchored
to known terrain. `--check` requires the 0000 record to exist.

Inventory the *given* surface concretely: which sources, stores, build steps, and
serving components already run today, and which the spec still asks to build.
Example — a brownfield data project might be: a source database, a seeder, a
read-only landing into a data store, and no transform or serving layer yet. Name
your own given surface explicitly; a reader must know what is *given* before
reading what *must hold*.

### Step 2 — Ground (check spec against the real system)

Pressure-test the spec against reality — run it, do not read about it:

- Run the project's data-prep / ingest step end to end, then confirm the real state matches what the spec assumed (e.g. row counts, freshness, or parity between a source and its landing).
- Confirm the current shape of the terrain: which layers actually exist versus which the spec still asks later passes to build.
- Read the source schema (or the equivalent contract for your stack) and interrogate the spec against it. Surface the 3–4 facts that would bite Pass 3 if assumed wrong. For example, in a relational/warehouse project these might be:
  - **Join:** how do the core entities actually relate? (e.g. a foreign-key seam such as `payments.order_id ... REFERENCES orders(order_id)`.)
  - **Grain:** what is the real time grain? (e.g. timestamp columns typed as `TIMESTAMPTZ` — UTC.)
  - **Metric:** what does a key business term actually mean against the real columns and any facilitator data that must never leak into the pipeline?

Every fact you intend to record must trace to a schema line, a row count, or a command output you actually observed.

### Step 3 — Record (write the ADRs)

For each grounding decision, scaffold and fill one `docs/adrs/NNNN-<slug>.md` with
the bundled script:

```bash
bash .claude/skills/tech-req-to-adrs/scripts/scaffold-adr.sh "payments join on order_id"
# → docs/adrs/0001-payments-join-on-order-id.md  (auto-numbered, dated, templated)
```

The script auto-increments `NNNN`, slugifies the title, stamps the date, and lays
down a fixed skeleton: YAML frontmatter (status born `proposed`, `spec_ref` for
the requirement IDs) + Context / Decision / **Rejected reading** (the worthiness
test says the fact could have been otherwise — record the otherwise so no later
agent re-litigates it) / Evidence (the observation AND the runnable command that
re-proves it, in a fenced block) / Consequences (ending in "Re-verify when: …" —
the event that would invalidate the fact). Fill it so each record states
**what is** and **what must hold**, cites its evidence, and names its
consequence for downstream passes — never a build instruction. Delete every
template comment as you fill: `--check` fails any record still carrying one,
and any required section left empty. Example — the representative set for a
relational/warehouse project might be:

- `0001-payments-join-on-order-id` — the only orders↔payments seam.
- `0002-utc-date-grain` — all time columns are `TIMESTAMPTZ`; the date grain is UTC.
- `0003-revenue-is-paid-only` — revenue counts paid payments, not order totals.
- `0004-control-data-never-lands` — facilitator/test-only data is fenced out; the pipeline only sees production sources.

Your set will name whatever seams, grains, and definitions your own terrain makes true.

**Not every fact deserves an ADR.** Write one only when all three hold:
(1) **hard to reverse** — assuming it wrong would cost real rework downstream;
(2) **downstream passes stand on it** — a plan, task, or eval will cite it;
(3) **it could plausibly have been otherwise** — a genuine ambiguity was
resolved, not a triviality restated. A fact that fails the test is a line in
the glossary or the context record, not its own numbered file — ADR inflation
buries the four decisions that matter under twenty that don't.

**Pin the vocabulary as it crystallizes (`docs/CONTEXT.md`).** Grounding is
where fuzzy business words meet real columns — "revenue", "active", "order"
stop being prose and start being definitions. The moment a term is resolved
(e.g. *revenue = sum of paid payments, not order totals*), write it into
`docs/CONTEXT.md` right there — don't batch it. The glossary holds **terms
only**: canonical name, one-line meaning, the evidence line it traces to.
No implementation details, no build notes — it is a dictionary, not a spec.
When a term in the tech-spec conflicts with how the data actually behaves,
that conflict is itself a grounding fact: resolve it, record the winner in
the glossary, and cite the evidence. Downstream passes (plans, task-specs,
harness KBs) use these canonical terms instead of re-deriving them.

## Gate — confirm before leaving this pass

Run the checker, then eyeball the invariant:

```bash
bash .claude/skills/tech-req-to-adrs/scripts/scaffold-adr.sh --check
```

- [ ] The terrain is **named** (greenfield or brownfield) in `0000-context.md` (`--check` enforces its presence).
- [ ] Every record's frontmatter `status` sits in the lifecycle enum; the pass closes with `--check --final` — nothing left `proposed`, supersede links bidirectional.
- [ ] Every ADR cites the requirement ID(s) it grounds (`spec_ref: R-n`) — the spec→ADR→plan→eval chain starts here.
- [ ] For brownfield, the base was *run*, not assumed: the project's data-prep/build step was executed and its real state reconciled against the spec's assumptions; the current layer inventory is confirmed.
- [ ] Every grounding decision is its own `docs/adrs/NNNN-<slug>.md` file.
- [ ] Each ADR records a **fact/constraint** with cited evidence — none says "build X" or designs a solution (`--check` greps for build-verbs and flags drift).
- [ ] Every structural fact the spec leans on (join/relationship rules, grain, key business definitions) is pinned to a real schema/source line or command output.
- [ ] Every ADR passes the three-condition worthiness test (hard to reverse · stood on downstream · could have been otherwise) — no ADR inflation.
- [ ] Every business term the spec leans on that could be misread ("revenue", "active", "order") is pinned in `docs/CONTEXT.md` — terms only, each tracing to its evidence.
- [ ] A reader with no session context can reconstruct the given-vs-build picture from `docs/adrs/` alone.

Converged = the checklist passes, not "feels done."

## Examples

**Example 1 — "Run the structure pass on the service."**
Actions: read the Pass 1 tech-spec (`docs/tech-spec-*.pdf|md`); run the project's
data-prep/build step and reconcile its real output against the spec's assumptions;
read the source schema (or equivalent contract); scaffold `0000-context`
(green/brownfield) plus one numbered ADR per structural fact the spec leans on; run
`scaffold-adr.sh --check`.
Result: `docs/adrs/` holds the records; `--check` is green; Pass 3 can read them.

**Example 2 — "Is this greenfield or brownfield, and what are we standing on?"**
Actions: Step 1 only — write `docs/adrs/0000-context.md` naming it green/brownfield
and listing the given surface (what runs today) vs. the build surface (what the spec
still asks later passes to add).
Result: the given-vs-build map is a file, not a memory.

**Example 3 — "Ground the spec against the repo" but the draft ADR says "build a fact table keyed on order_id."**
Actions: split it. Keep the fact (e.g. `0001-payments-join-on-order-id`: payments
join orders on `order_id`); delete the build clause and hand the "fact table" design
to Pass 3.
Result: the ADR passes `--check`; no design leaks into Pass 2.

## Troubleshooting

- **`--check` fails: "build-verb detected in ADR".** → An ADR designs a solution (build/create/implement/add). → Split it: keep the fact, move the design to Pass 3 (`reqs-to-swimlane-plans`).
- **The real state disagrees with the spec (e.g. row counts differ between a source and its landing).** → The prep step was stale or something changed a record mid-run. → Re-run the project's data-prep step; if the discrepancy persists, it IS a grounding fact — record it (e.g. an ADR on which anomalies survive into the landing).
- **No tech-spec exists.** → Pass 1 has not run. → Stop and run `brd-docs-to-tech-req` first; Pass 2 needs the spec as input.
- **Tempted to write "build X".** → You have left terrain altitude. → Stop; that belongs to Pass 3. Pass 2 records only what *is* and what *must hold*.
- **Facilitator/test-only data leaks into the pipeline.** → A fence that should exclude it failed. → That is a real defect and a grounding fact; record it and flag the leak, do not silently drop it.

## Handoff

→ **`reqs-to-swimlane-plans`** (Pass 3, DECOMPOSE) reads `docs/adrs/*.md` as its
grounding inputs and splits the system at its real seams into `swimlanes/*.plan`
files. Every plan must trace back to a fact recorded here, may not contradict
a recorded ADR, and uses the canonical terms pinned in `docs/CONTEXT.md`.

*Optional debrief:* **`pass-to-lesson`** (`cvg lesson`) teaches what this pass just produced — every component, the decision it encodes, what breaks downstream without it — before the descent continues.

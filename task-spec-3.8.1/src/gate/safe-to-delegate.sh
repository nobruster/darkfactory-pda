# safe-to-delegate.sh — single pre-delegation gate for a Task-Spec.
#
# Composes the existing validator + runner into one go/no-go verdict so the
# eval-discipline ritual is one command, not three. Run this before handing a
# spec to Kimi/Codex/any executor blind.
#
# It answers: "are this spec's evals well-formed enough to delegate safely?"
#   - structurally valid (validate-task-spec.sh)
#   - eval bodies are shellcheck-clean (no syntax / unquoted-var bugs)
#   - eval bodies EXECUTE without bash errors (broken-logic guard)
#   - the evals can tell real work from a STUB (existence-only evals block
#     blind delegation; --supervised downgrades that to a note)
#
# For a not-yet-built task the evals are EXPECTED to fail (the work isn't done).
# That is fine — a delegate-safe spec fails for the RIGHT reason (assertion not
# yet true) rather than the WRONG reason (the eval itself is broken bash).
#
# Usage:
#   bash safe-to-delegate.sh <path/to/T-*.md>
#   bash safe-to-delegate.sh --skip-touches-paths <path>   # greenfield create tasks
#   bash safe-to-delegate.sh --require-tier1 <path>         # demand crypto trust
#   bash safe-to-delegate.sh --supervised <path>            # a human reads the diff
#
# Machine-readable contract (for automated dispatchers):
#   On a clean DELEGATE verdict for a signed-off spec, the gate emits exactly
#   one line of the form `TIER=N` (N = 1|2|3) to stdout. A dispatcher SHOULD
#   parse that line rather than the colored prose:
#     TIER=1  crypto trust (HMAC verified)        -> unsupervised dispatch OK
#     TIER=2  structural-only (no key / no sig)   -> SUPERVISED dispatch ONLY
#     TIER=3  HMAC mismatch                        -> never reached here (hard FAIL)
#   An unsigned spec (no `signed_off: true`) emits no TIER line.
#   With --require-tier1, anything below Tier 1 makes the gate exit 1 — turning
#   the "supervised-only" policy into an enforced control for CI pipelines.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — DELEGATE: spec is safe to hand off (Tier 1, or Tier 2 without --require-tier1)
#   1 — DO NOT DELEGATE: structural error, broken eval, shellcheck failure, or
#       (with --require-tier1) a sign-off below Tier 1
#   2 — usage / file error

# is "re-run safe-to-delegate.sh --stamp to re-seal", and that remedy was
# UNREACHABLE: the validator raises the HMAC mismatch as a blocker in Gate 1,
# and the --stamp branch only runs when blockers == 0. So the one legitimate way
# to amend a sealed spec dead-ended in the error telling you to use it, and the
# only way through was to hand-strip the sig — exactly what the docs forbid.
#
# `--stamp` IS the act of signing off: it declares that the body as it stands
# now is the thing being signed. So the previous signature is superseded by
# definition and is retired here, before anything reads it. This grants no
# authority — the fresh MAC still requires the signing key, and without one the
# spec lands at Tier 2 (supervised only) just as it would on a first stamp.

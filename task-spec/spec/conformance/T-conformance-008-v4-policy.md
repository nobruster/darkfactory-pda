# Preserve the format-v4 evidence policy

> **Why:** An executor must receive the policy but must not silently weaken it.

## Goal

Record that format v4 and its deterministic evidence requirement were observed.

## Success Criteria

```bash
eval_1() {
  grep -qx 'format=4 deterministic=required environment=optional evidence=sealed policy=preserved' spec/conformance/_workdir/c008.log
}
```

## Validation Card

```yaml

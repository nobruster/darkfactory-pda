# {{TITLE}}

> **Why:** {{WHY_ONE_PARAGRAPH}}

---

## Goal

{{GOAL_ONE_PARAGRAPH}}

---

## Context

{{CONTEXT_LEAN_MAX_100_LINES}}

For the feature-level PRD/design this task decomposes from, see the `parent:`
frontmatter field — that document is REFERENCED, never copied here. Zone 1 carries
only the one-paragraph distillation needed to execute this atomic unit.

---

## Behavior

Given/When/Then scenarios the implementation must satisfy. Each scenario has a
stable `B-N` id; every eval in the Validation Card declares which behavior(s) it
`verifies:`, and the validator enforces the chain both ways (no orphan behavior,
no orphan eval). Lite-profile specs may omit this section.

- **B-1** — GIVEN {{B1_GIVEN}} WHEN {{B1_WHEN}} THEN {{B1_THEN}}
- **B-2** — GIVEN {{B2_GIVEN}} WHEN {{B2_WHEN}} THEN {{B2_THEN}}

(Replace with `(none — lite profile, behavior implied by evals)` only on a lite-profile spec.)

---

## Success Criteria

Each criterion is a runnable bash function returning 0 (pass) or non-zero (fail).
Each MUST be terminal (deterministic, idempotent, non-flaky).

```bash
# eval-1: {{EVAL_1_DESCRIPTION}}
eval_1() {
  {{EVAL_1_BASH}}
}

# eval-2: {{EVAL_2_DESCRIPTION}}
eval_2() {
  {{EVAL_2_BASH}}
}

# eval-3: {{EVAL_3_DESCRIPTION}}
eval_3() {
  {{EVAL_3_BASH}}
}
```

---

## Validation Card

```yaml
success_criteria:
  # check_type: deterministic (default, bash-checked, preferred) | llm_judge
  # (subjective criteria graded by a fast LLM via judge_prompt — deterministic-first).
  # verifies: the behavior id(s) this eval proves. Standard/full profiles require
  # every B-N to be covered by >=1 eval and every eval to map to a behavior.
  - id: eval_1
    description: {{EVAL_1_DESCRIPTION}}
    runnable: bash
    check_type: deterministic
    verifies: [B-1]
    terminal: true
    expected_duration_sec: {{EVAL_1_DURATION}}
  - id: eval_2
    description: {{EVAL_2_DESCRIPTION}}
    runnable: bash
    check_type: deterministic
    verifies: [B-2]
    terminal: true
    expected_duration_sec: {{EVAL_2_DURATION}}
  - id: eval_3
    description: {{EVAL_3_DESCRIPTION}}
    runnable: bash
    check_type: deterministic
    verifies: [B-1, B-2]
    terminal: true
    expected_duration_sec: {{EVAL_3_DURATION}}

```

---

## Exit Check

```bash
# Final proof-of-done. Returns 0 only when ALL evals pass.
eval_1 && eval_2 && eval_3
```

---

## Rollback Plan

If execution fails mid-task, revert to the pre-task state:

1. **Git revert** — `git revert --no-commit HEAD` (if commits were made)
2. **File restore** — `git checkout -- <paths>` for any modified files not yet committed
3. **State reset** — update task status to `parked` and record `blocked_reason`

{{ROLLBACK_SPECIFIC_STEPS}}

(Replace with `(none — this task is append-only or additive with no destructive changes)` if no rollback is needed. Full profile requires concrete steps.)

---

## Observability Hooks

What to watch during execution and after deployment:

- **Expected duration:** {{OBSERVABILITY_EXPECTED_DURATION}}
- **Key metric:** {{OBSERVABILITY_KEY_METRIC}}
- **Alert condition:** {{OBSERVABILITY_ALERT_CONDITION}}
- **Log tail:** {{OBSERVABILITY_LOG_TAIL}}

(Replace with `(none — no runtime observability required)` if not applicable. Full profile requires real hooks.)

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't {{ANTI_1_ACTION}}** — {{ANTI_1_REASON}}. {{ANTI_1_INSTEAD}}.
- **Don't {{ANTI_2_ACTION}}** — {{ANTI_2_REASON}}. {{ANTI_2_INSTEAD}}.
- **Don't {{ANTI_3_ACTION}}** — {{ANTI_3_REASON}}. {{ANTI_3_INSTEAD}}.

---

## Do-Not-Touch

Files the executor MUST NOT modify:

{{DO_NOT_TOUCH_LIST}}

---

## Open Questions

Things the executor should resolve DURING build, not assume:

1. **{{QUESTION_1}}** — {{QUESTION_1_CONTEXT}}
2. **{{QUESTION_2}}** — {{QUESTION_2_CONTEXT}}

(Replace with `(none — this task is fully specified)` if no open questions remain.)

# Generate the evidence-backed quality score and release audit

> **Why:** The 97-point claim must be calculated from retained evidence and fail closed on missing proof.

## Goal

Implement QualityRubric/v1, scorecard generation, generated README status, and make release-audit.

## Context

(none — the manifest contains all execution context)

## Behavior

- **B-1** — GIVEN retained evidence with matching digests WHEN the release audit runs THEN the score is derived from fixed criteria without trusting a manually entered total
- **B-2** — GIVEN missing, pending, unavailable, tampered, or mismatched evidence WHEN the audit runs THEN the affected points are denied and the blocking gate fails

## Success Criteria

```bash
# eval_1: score derivation and evidence falsifiers pass
eval_1() {
  bash tests/test-release-audit.sh
}

```

## Validation Card

```yaml
success_criteria:
  - id: eval_1
    description: "score derivation and evidence falsifiers pass"
    runnable: bash
    check_type: deterministic
    verifies: [B-1, B-2]
    terminal: true
    expected_duration_sec: 45
retry_policy:
  max_iterations: 15
  circuit_breaker_no_progress: 3
  on_terminal_failure: park_with_context
agent_contract:
  version: 2
  read: [intent, behavior, contract, guardrails]
  produce: [code, tests]
  required_tools: [git, bash]
  timeout_minutes: 30
  sandbox_type: host
  output_artifacts: []
  mcp_dependencies: []
  emit: [pass, fail, retry_with_reason, parked_with_context]
  backend_metadata: {}
```

## Exit Check

```bash
eval_1
```

## Rollback Plan

Revert only the declared write surface and park the task with context.

## Observability Hooks

(none — no runtime observability required)

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not turn a local pass, contract declaration, or synthetic fixture into external proof.

## Do-Not-Touch

- `release/3.8.1/external`

## Open Questions

(none — this task is fully specified)

# Implement the repository-local TaskMesh daemon and durable state

> **Why:** Cockpits need one durable repository runtime that survives client exit without moving canonical authority into its database.

## Goal

Build the optional Go helper with SQLite WAL, protected repository-scoped sockets, event replay, idempotent commands, and foreground or auto-start operation.

## Context

(none — the manifest contains all execution context)

## Behavior

- **B-1** — GIVEN one resolved repository WHEN multiple clients connect THEN they negotiate with one daemon identified by the canonical repository path
- **B-2** — GIVEN a daemon restart WHEN durable events are replayed THEN the same TaskMeshView is reconstructed without changing Task-Spec files
- **B-3** — GIVEN runtime directories and sockets WHEN they are created THEN directory and socket permissions are private and runtime state is ignored by Git

## Success Criteria

```bash
# eval_1: daemon lifecycle, SQLite WAL, permissions, idempotency, and replay pass
eval_1() {
  bash tests/test-mesh-daemon.sh
}

```

## Validation Card

```yaml
success_criteria:
  - id: eval_1
    description: "daemon lifecycle, SQLite WAL, permissions, idempotency, and replay pass"
    runnable: bash
    check_type: deterministic
    verifies: [B-1, B-2, B-3]
    terminal: true
    expected_duration_sec: 120
retry_policy:
  max_iterations: 15
  circuit_breaker_no_progress: 3
  on_terminal_failure: park_with_context
agent_contract:
  version: 2
  read: [intent, behavior, contract, guardrails]
  produce: [code, tests]
  required_tools: [git, bash]
  timeout_minutes: 30
  sandbox_type: host
  output_artifacts: []
  mcp_dependencies: []
  emit: [pass, fail, retry_with_reason, parked_with_context]
  backend_metadata: {}
```

## Exit Check

```bash
eval_1
```

## Rollback Plan

Revert only the declared write surface and park the task with context.

## Observability Hooks

(none — no runtime observability required)

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not require a hosted service or external database.

## Do-Not-Touch

- `tasks/done`

## Open Questions

(none — this task is fully specified)

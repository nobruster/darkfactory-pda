# Seamwise — Claude Code project guide

Seamwise is an architecture-aware decomposition compiler. It takes one approved
initiative and produces one reviewed `TaskPlan/v1` plus digest-bound lineage.
It does not materialize tasks and holds no dispatch authority.

Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the full agent contract. This file covers how to
work in the repository.

## The invariant

> Seamwise decomposes. Task-Spec contracts. Converge coordinates.

Never import, vendor, invoke, or reimplement Task-Spec. Never parse Task-Spec
Markdown or terminal prose as an integration contract. Seamwise emits two
boundary artifacts and stops; an external coordinator takes it from there.

## Commands

```bash
uv sync --extra dev --locked   # set up the environment
make check                     # the complete release gate — run before claiming done
make test                      # pytest only
make cov                       # pytest with branch coverage and missing lines
make lint                      # ruff format --check and ruff check
make typecheck                 # strict mypy
make build                     # wheel and sdist
```

`make check` is authoritative. It runs lint, strict mypy, tests with a coverage
floor, host-adapter and documentation validation, a wheel build, release-asset
assembly, doctor, host-plugin install/uninstall, a clean-room wheel lifecycle
with independent Task-Spec `TaskPlan/v1` validation, and Git whitespace checks.

The CLI pipeline, in order:

```bash
seamwise --workspace <path> init
seamwise --workspace <path> map --source <recipe.yaml>
seamwise --workspace <path> plan      # stops at DELIVERY_PLAN=NEEDS_REVIEW
seamwise --workspace <path> review --accept --reviewer <name> --reason <text>
seamwise --workspace <path> compile   # writes task-plan.json and lineage
seamwise --workspace <path> status
```

## Engine architecture

`seamwise.engine` is a package of stage modules with a strict one-way
dependency direction. Keep it acyclic when adding code.

```
support  →  recipe  →  seams  →  planning  →  graph  →  compilation
```

- `support.py` — leaf helpers: diagnostics, path canonicalization, events.
- `recipe.py` — recipe loading and fail-closed semantic validation.
- `seams.py` — recipe to seam map, and seam-map verification.
- `planning.py` — delivery plan build, human review acceptance, verification.
- `graph.py` — task-graph projection, topological sort, critical path, Mermaid.
- `compilation.py` — TaskPlan and lineage compilation, lineage inspection.

`engine/__init__.py` re-exports the nine public names. Import from
`seamwise.engine`, not from the stage modules, outside the package.

## Conventions

- Python 3.11+; ruff line length 100; rules `E,F,I,UP,B,SIM,RUF` with `E501` off.
- mypy runs `strict = true` over `src/seamwise`. The package ships `py.typed`.
- Branch coverage must stay at or above 78 percent.
- Every JSON-mode command returns exactly one `SeamwiseCLIResult/v1` object.
  Automation parses that envelope, never Rich terminal output.
- Exit codes: `0` success or intended boundary, `2` input required, `3` invalid
  command or contract, `4` integrity or topology conflict, `5` host runtime
  unavailable, `10` internal failure.

## Fail-closed rules

- `plan` always stops at `DELIVERY_PLAN=NEEDS_REVIEW`. Never bypass it.
- `compile` refuses without a current review receipt bound to the exact
  delivery-plan digest. Editing the plan makes the receipt stale.
- `compile` writes both artifacts in one lock-protected transaction, or neither.
- `status` independently rebuilds the graph, TaskPlan, and lineage projections;
  altered, partial, or stale artifacts return `STATUS=BLOCKED`.
- Add positive, adversarial, tamper, and failure-route tests before claiming a
  behavior-bearing change is done.

## Gotchas

- **Recipe evidence resolves through the repository root.** `_verify_local_recipe_sources`
  in `engine/recipe.py` tries `source.parent`, then the workspace root, then
  `assets_root()` — which is the repo root in a source checkout. The proving
  fixture cites `tests/fixtures/blueprint.md` and hashes it, so deleting or
  editing that file breaks most of the suite. Update the digest in
  `tests/fixtures/rate-limiting-recipe.yaml` and `scripts/clean_room_e2e.py`
  together if you ever change it.
- **The clean-room step needs Task-Spec exactly 3.8.0.** It runs last and exits
  `CLEAN_ROOM=BLOCKED` (exit 5) when `PATH` or `TASKSPEC_BIN` is any other
  version. Doctor and host-plugin have already run. CI pins 3.8.0.
- **`docs/` does not exist.** Documentation is being rebuilt. Historical
  decision records are recoverable from Git history.
